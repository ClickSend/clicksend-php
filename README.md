How To Build: 
=============
The generated code uses a PHP library namely UniRest. The reference to this
library is already added as a composer dependency in the generated composer.json
file. Therefore, you will need internet access to resolve this dependency.

Installation:
===========

****For using this SDK do the following:****

	1. Go to sdk project root folder.
	2. Use composer to install the dependencies. If you don't have composer you can download it on https://getcomposer.org/download
	3. Enter command `composer update` to install dependencies.

Sample Code:
=============

***Send SMS***

```php
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

use ClickSendV3APILib\Controllers\SMSController;

$messages =  [

            "from" => "sendmobile",
            "body" => "Jelly liquorice marshmallow candy carrot cake 4Eyffjs1vL.",
            "to" => "+61411111111",
